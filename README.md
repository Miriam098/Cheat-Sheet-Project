#Cheat-Sheet-Project

> In this project I am building my own reference cheat sheet to help me build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

**This is a codecedemy based project. The aim is to practice my Web design Skills.**
